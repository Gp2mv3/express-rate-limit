## `req.rateLimit`

A `req.rateLimit` property is added to all requests with the `limit`, `used`,
and `remaining` number of requests and, if the store provides it, a `resetTime`
Date object. These may be used in your application code to take additional
actions or inform the user of their status.

Note that `used` includes the current request, so it should always be > 0.

The property name can be configured with the configuration option
[`requestPropertyName`](/reference/configuration#requestpropertyname).
