## `resetKey(key)`

Resets the rate limiting for a given key. An example use case is to allow users
to complete a captcha to reset their rate limit, then call this function.

## `getKey(key)`

Retrieves the hit count and reset time from the store for a given key.

Note: `getKey` depends on store support. It works with the MemoryStore and
cluster-memory-store, but may not work with other stores. Calling it will throw
an error if the store does not have a `get` method.
